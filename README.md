# eyeTrain
eyeTrain is a webcam oriented game where the user uses their eyes to play through a dance dance revolution type game. The purpose of this is to try to minimize the effects of eye strain by making an engaging game out of it. The resolution is a bit wonky and might have to be readjusted to fit your own monitor, but the escape key should work at all times to exit the game.
